## LifeHashes In Five Flavors

LifeHashes can be displayed in one of five ways (one of which is deprecated:

* **`version1`** The Original. **DEPRECATED**
* **`version2`** Bug fixes and CMYK-friendly. The **OFFICIAL** version of LifeHash.
* **`detailed`** Twice the resolution and CMYK-friendly.
* **`fiducial`** [Fiducials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiducial_marker#Fiducial_marker_sets) are symbols specifically optimized for recognition by machine vision algorithms like those in Apple's [ARKit](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/arkit/). Now CMYK-friendly.
* **`grayscaleFiducial`** Highest contrast for low-light situations.

⚠️ **NOTE:** The images generated by LifeHash from a given seed will not be recognizably similar between each of these versions. So pick the one you want to use for your application and stick with it!
